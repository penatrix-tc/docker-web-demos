# RDM-9 Sample Submission for Python + Flask

This sample submission should be extended with the required functionality in the RDM-9 problems.

1. The port on which the server listens should not be changed. The automated tester expects the submission to run on port 8080.

2. Do not submit the `tester` folder and `docker-compose.yml`, they should only be used by competitors for simulating the final testing locally.
